# Yen-for-future-LinearRegression

This short assignment shows a machine learning process. First cleaning the data and making sure all the features are correct for use. Then dividing the data into train and test features so that we can look at comparisons within the data. I used Sckitlearn tool for generating the machine learning results. At the end we can see that the predicted values were way off from that the actual returns were.
